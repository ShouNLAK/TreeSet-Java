## ðŸš€ Features

- **Default Ordering TreeSet**: Stores elements in ascending order.
- **Comparator-based TreeSet**: Stores elements in descending order using a custom comparator.
- **TreeSet from User Input**: Allows users to enter values via the keyboard.
- **Randomized TreeSet**: Generates random values and stores them.
- **TreeSet from an Array**: Converts an array into a `TreeSet` to remove duplicates.
- **TreeSet from a File**: Reads values from `input.txt` and stores them.
- **Search Operations**: Allows searching for elements in the TreeSet.
- **Deletion Operations**: Enables removing elements from the TreeSet.
- **Statistics on TreeSet**: Provides insights such as the smallest/largest elements and subsets.
- **Conversion to Array**: Transforms `TreeSet` into an array.
- **Clearing Elements**: Removes all elements from the TreeSet.
